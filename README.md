# Kashi's Website
## Prismic frontend

This Gatsby static site consumes a [prismic.io](https://prismic.io) API endpoint for content, and is hosted by Netlify on [kashis.com.au](https://kashis.com.au) and the corresponding [develop](https://develop.kashis.com.au) subdomain.

## Why this website exists
This was built as a way to connect a headless CMS (currently provided by prismic.io) with a static HTML site, using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to extract data.

This project was started as a replacement to the previous static site hosted on [kashis.com.au](https://kashis.com.au) as a way to explore [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as a site generator.

## What's required to get started
You'll need a recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Run `npm install` once you've cloned this repository, and the [`gatsby-cli`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) will allow you to develop and build accordingly.
